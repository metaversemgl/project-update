# project-update
After many efforts by the MetaverseMGL technical team, with the cooperation of 6 other top coding teams, the MetaverseMGL project engine will be launched after security tests and obtaining the necessary approvals. By launching this engine, you will understand the difference between Metaverse projects.
Many Metaverse projects have been able to gain market share by using ready-made engines without any technology or innovation, and only with advertising and hype.
Be prepared for the Barachiel engine to open a new window to the world of Metaverse.
